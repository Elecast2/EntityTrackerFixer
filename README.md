# EntityTrackerFixer
Untrack entities that are not used at all by the server.

Did you try everything to fix the lag on your server 1.14.4 or 1.17 but it is still lagging?
Do timings indicate some random entity is causing lag?

This plugin may help you.
Available from 1.14.4 to 1.17.

How does it works?
Minecraft tracks a lot of entities, even if they are outside the tracking range of the player, that's a normal behavior but is a tps killer for 1.14.4 and 1.17 servers with more than 30 players. So what this plugin do is untrack those entities every configured ticks and track them again if the player is near.
